# Biodiversity
## Project goals
This project aims to analyze the data coming from two datasets in order to investigate the biodiversity in US National Parks included in the above mentioned datasets. The project is largely exploratory, intending to summarize the data in a concise and clear way and provide a general overview of various statistics that should be relevant to park authorities and relevant scientists.</br>
</br>
The project will address the following questions:</br>
</br>
1. How many species are included in the datasets? What is their break-down in the context of respective species categories?</br>
2. What is the break-down of conservation status in the context of respective species categories? Which category is most likely to be placed under protection?</br>
3. In the context of their conservation status, are there any statistically significant differences between different species categories?</br>
4. How do the parks included in the dataset compare to each other in terms of reported number of species and observations?</br>
5. How do the parks compare to each other in terms of their percentage of observations of protected animals?</br>
6. What is the distribution of the number of observations for every conservation status group?</br>
